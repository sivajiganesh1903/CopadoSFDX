    <help><!-- Ancestor Id is used to specify an existing promoted (published) package version. It is specified as a package version id (04t) or as a package version alias. In Copado, this field reflects the value in your project configuration (sfdx-project.json) and cannot be edited from the UI. Be mindful of what version is used as ancestor as package ancestry impacts which package version upgrades are allowed. --></help>
