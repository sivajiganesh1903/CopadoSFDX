    <help><!-- Ancestor Version is used to specify an existing promoted (published) package version. It is typically specified in the format, e.g., 4.6.0 or using a keyword like HIGHEST. In Copado, this field reflects the value in your project configuration (sfdx-project.json) and cannot be edited from the UI. Be mindful of what version is used as ancestor as package ancestry impacts which package version upgrades are allowed. --></help>
